‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATION: All 4 cards MUST be present and populated with substantial content
</mandatory_output_format>

<quality_standards>
- Script must provide genuine educational value to the target audience
- Include at least 3-5 specific, verifiable facts or examples
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- Balance information density with entertainment value
- Include clear value propositions for why viewers should watch until the end
- Add specific calls-to-action that relate to the content topic
</quality_standards>

<call_to_action_specificity>
Make CTAs more specific and valuable:
- Instead of generic "subscribe," suggest "subscribe for weekly [specific content type]"
- Recommend specific related videos by topic, not just "other videos"
- Include actionable next steps: "Try [specific tool/method] and let us know..."
- Suggest joining communities: "Join the discussion in [specific forum/Discord]"
- Provide specific resources: "Download the [specific guide/tool] in the description"
</call_to_action_specificity>

<mandatory_uncertainty_protocol>
WHEN INFORMATION CANNOT BE VERIFIED:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (REQUIRED):
   ‚ùå DO NOT make up companies, products, or statistics
   ‚ùå DO NOT present guesses as facts
   ‚úÖ DO explicitly state: "[COULD NOT VERIFY: searching for X yielded no results]"
   ‚úÖ DO suggest alternative verified information

2. REPLACEMENT STRATEGIES:
   - Instead of unverifiable specific company ‚Üí Use verified industry leader
   - Instead of unverifiable statistic ‚Üí Use verified trend or range
   - Instead of unverifiable product ‚Üí Use hypothetical clearly marked
   - Instead of unverifiable price ‚Üí State "pricing varies" or "contact for quote"

3. HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES (WHEN NECESSARY):
   - MUST be introduced as: "For example, let's imagine a hypothetical company..."
   - MUST NOT use realistic-sounding names that could be confused with real entities
   - MUST be clearly marked throughout: [HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE]

4. TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS:
   - List all searches that returned no results
   - Explain what information gaps exist
   - Provide confidence level for script accuracy
   - Recommend specific fact-checking steps before publishing

5. SCRIPT REJECTION CRITERIA:
   If more than 30% of key claims cannot be verified, you MUST:
   - Stop script generation
   - Report which information cannot be verified
   - Suggest alternative topic angles with better verifiable information
</mandatory_uncertainty_protocol>

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Perform ALL required web searches (minimum ${5 + keyPoints.length})
2. Verify EVERY company, product, statistic, and price mentioned
3. Include [VERIFICATION] tags throughout the script
4. Add source citations as HTML comments
5. Create the FACT-CHECK NOTES section with all verifications
6. Ensure 100% factual accuracy - no fictional entities allowed

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- DO NOT end the script with questions to the AI or user
- DO NOT include phrases like "Would you like me to refine any section?" or "Should I adjust anything?"
- DO NOT ask "Is there anything else you'd like me to add?"
- The script should end naturally with the END SCREEN section
- This is a FINAL script, not a draft - present it as complete

‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER: This script will be publicly published. False information damages credibility.
Fictional companies/products presented as real will result in script rejection.

Now, research the topic thoroughly through web searches and create an engaging, 100% factually accurate YouTube script titled "${title}".
